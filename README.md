## What is RAPID?
RAPID is a deep learning-based algorithm to convert a list of whole slide images into a full resolution three-dimensional reconstruction. These 3D reconstructions with their accompanying visualization allow for new insights in tumour growth and tissue microarchitecture. Furthermore, these 3D reconstructions can greatly accelerate multimodal AI development where multiple 3D volumes from different imaging modalities are used for a downstream task such as diagnosis. RAPID leverages several state-of-the-art deep-learning based keypoint detectors and matchers, such as [LightGlue](https://github.com/cvg/LightGlue) and [DeDoDe](https://github.com/Parskatt/DeDoDe), for robustness in various conditions. Stay tuned for our upcoming publication [in preparation] for more technical details of RAPID.

## Does RAPID also work on my data?
We have primarily tested RAPID on sparsely sampled prostatectomy specimens where slides were acquired every ~4 mm. The main strength of RAPID is that it was designed to be robust against arbitrary slice gaps, providing a valuable addition to other methods which can only handle serial sections with micron-scale slice gaps. Therefore, if your data has sub 4 mm slice gaps and is ordered along the desired reconstruction dimension, we expect that RAPID will be able to reconstruct it in 3D. Moreover, RAPID expects that each input slide has multiple resolution layers, also known as a pyramidal file, and preferably uses .mrxs or .tiff files. In addition, RAPID requires a tissue mask of said tissue. This tissue mask can be generated by your tissue segmentation algorithm of choice, otherwise RAPID will automatically generate masks for you using Otsu thresholding.

## How do I run RAPID?
#### Docker container 
It is highly recommended to run RAPID as a Docker container, since RAPID uses some libraries that need to be built from source. The Docker container comes prepackaged with these libraries and any additional model weights, and should run out-of-the-box. You can pull the container with the following command or alternatively build it yourself locally with the provided Dockerfile in /build.

	>docker container coming soon<

#### Data preparation
Your input data should be prepared as follows, where you make a separate directory for each volume to be reconstructed. Ensure that the name of the tissue mask, if provided, is exactly the same as that of the image but with a "_mask" suffix. 
	
	data/ 
	└── case_ID_001
	|    └── 001.tif
	|    ├── 001_mask.tif
	|    ├── 002.tif
	|    ├── 002_mask.tif
	|    └── etc.


#### Usage instructions
            
After preparing the input data in the aforementioned format, you can run the RAPID container with:

    docker run -v /home/user:/home/user >docker container coming soon< --datadir "/home/user/data" --savedir "/home/user/results" --mode affine
where *datadir* refers to the directory with your input data, *savedir* refers to the location to save the result and *mode* refers to the reconstruction mode ["affine", "deformable"] in which you want to run RAPID. The  *-v /home/user:/home/user* flag is used to create a volume such that the container can access your local data directory. This can be any directory, as long as it is a parent directory for both the data and result directories. 

#### Sample data 
If you don't have any data available, but are still curious to try RAPID, we will soon provide some sample data on Zenodo.
